angular expressions
    javascript-like code snippets placed in bindings such as {{expr}}
    likes 1+2, a+b, user.name, items[index]

differences with javascript expressions
    context: evaluated against a scope object rather than the global window
    forgiving: to undefined and null, or to generate ReferenceError
    no control flow statements: conditionals, loops, or exceptions
    no function declarations: cannot declare functions, even inside ng-init
    no RegExp creation with literal notation
    no comma and void operators
    filters: to format data before displaying it

to run more complex javascript code
    make it a controller method and call it from the view
    use the $eval() method

context
    angular uses $parse service to evalate expressions
    angular exprs cannot access global variables like window, document or location
    use services like $window and $location instead

forgiving
    to undefined and null, and used for data binding
    make more sense to show nothing than to throw an exception

$event
