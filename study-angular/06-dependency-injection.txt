dependency injection
    a software design pattern
    how components get hold of their dependencies

angular injector subsystem in charge of
    createing components
    resolving their dependencies
    providing them to other components as requested

factory methods
    to define a directive, service, or filter
    are registered with modules

module methods
    config method runs at configuration time for a module
    run method runs at run time for a module
    they are injectable with dependencies just like factory methods

controllers
    similarity to classes or constructor functions
    providing the application behavior
    supporting the declarative markup in the template
    using the array notation to declare controllers
    many instances of the same type of controller in an app

dependency annotation
    annotate parameters to inject them into functions
    three ways of annotating your code
        inline array annotation(preferred)
        $inject property annotation
        implicitly from the function parameter names
