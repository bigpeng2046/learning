filter
    formats the value of an expression for display to the user
    used in view templates, controllers or services
    it is easy to define your own filter

using filters in view templates
    {{ expression | filter }}
    {{ expression | filter1 | filter2 | ... }}
    {{ expression | filter:arg1:arg2:... }}

using filters in controllers, services, and directives
    inject a dependency with the name <filterName>Filter
    the injected argument is a function like: filterFunc(theValue, theParam)

creating custom filters
    register a new filter factory function with your module
    return a new filter function
        the first argument is the input value
        the additional arguments as parameters
    the filter function should be a pure function: stateless and idempotent

stateful filters
    strongly discouraged because it cannot be optimized
    mark the filter as $stateful
