services

substitutable objects that are wired together using DI
use services to organize and share code across your app

lazily instantiated: when an app component depends on it
singletons: only a single instance generated by the service factory

define services by registering with an angular module
    service name
    service factory function
        generates the single object or function that represents the service
        the object or function injected into any component
