what are directives?
    markers on a DOM element(attribute, element name, comment or CSS class)
    attach a specified behavior to the DOM element
    event transform the DOM element and its children
    by angularJS's HTML compiler($compile)

built-in directives
    ngBind, ngModel, ngClass, ...

matching directives
    how $compile determines when to use a given directive
    refer to directives by their case-sensitive camelCase normalized name(e.g. ngModel)
    the normalization process
        1. strip x- and data- from the front of the element/attributes
        2. convert the :, -, or _-delimited name to camelCase
    matches attribute name, tag name, class names, or class name

creating directives
    directives are registered on modules:
        module.directive(directiveName, factoryFunction() {})
    an object with options returned by the function to tell $compile
        how the directive should behave when matched
    the function is invoked only once when matched for the first time
    the function is invoked using $injector.invoke
